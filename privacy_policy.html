<h3>Other Usage and Sharing</h3>

<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>We may serve ads based on your information we collect about you within our Services, or place ads on third party websites, apps and internet-connected devices. This information may include:</p>

Please note that if you opt out, you may still have advertisements in the game, but they will not be targeted advertisements (advertisements that are tailored to your interests by using your information).</p>
<h3>Marketing Partners</h3>
<p>There are various third-party marketing partners we use to help market our games. With the help of your information collected when you use their services, they make assumptions to ensure that most relevant advertising that you would prefer to see is presented and evaluate the effectiveness of advertisements.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not cover the data use of our marketing partners, but they are required to have a legal basis to use your data for marketing purposes and to provide you the details on how it's being used.</p>
<h2>Advertising</h2>
<p>Our games include advertising for third party products and services. We and our partners use your information to improve advertising and targeting for third party ads that are shown in our games.

<h3>Advertising Partners</h3>
<p>Non-personal identifiers and other information that is collected from your device when you play our games or use our Services may be shared with advertising partners in order to deliver ads to your device. Such information may be combined with information that our advertising partners collect separately to serve you with more relevant ads (targeted ads) and to enhance the accuracy of their targeting.</p>
<h3>Ad Identifiers</h3>
<p>We use ad identifiers that are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers such as the Android and/or Apple's ID for advertising associated with your device, and similar technologies such as tracking pixels within ads to provide interest-based advertising. These technologies enable us and our third-party advertising partners to recognize you and your device, allow our Services to interact with a third-party social network or platform, and help our payment processors to complete your payment instructions.</p>
